    <h2>European Travel Narrative</h2>
        <h3>National Identity</h3>
          <p> Superior because of technology; entitled to the land and economic; not going to hear the natives out </p>
        <h3>Worldview</h3>
          <p> God, glory, gold; Judeo-Christian with scientific influences; "I will conquer you
            because I am more powerful" </p>
        <h3>Characteristics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Expedition plagued by intrigue and disunity (leader comes together to unite a lazy crew)</li>
            <li>Triumph of the explorer</li>
            <li>Comparison of old life vs. new life</li>

          <p>Through tweaking reality, Columbus and de Vaca display themselves as heroes; hyperbole for those who opposed them (huge beasts, arrows that could pierce trees) this displays traits of Native American myth, they make themselves extra human and the natives protohuman.</p>

    <h2>Anti-Transcendentalism</h2>
      <h3>Existential Beliefs</h3>
        <p> Man is born with the stain of the original sin, man is the most destructive force in nature, one can only find God through good works and life experience. There are no Universal truths just individual truths, and there is no oversoul just Heaven and Hell. These keynotes in each philosophy are essential in understanding the foundation of both these beliefs</p>
      <h3>Moral Beliefs</h3>
        <p>Transcendentalists oppose this with the belief that God can only be reached though good works and experience. They feel living a good life, doing good deeds, and experiencing life through one's work is the only way to find God;  believe man will naturally choose wrong over right if given the choice between the two; God can only be reached though good works and experience; feel living a good life, doing good deeds, and experiencing life through one's work is the only way to find God</p>
